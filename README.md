# Readwits

Readwits is a free web application that allows you to find a book you want to read next.

### Prerequisites

This project is build with vanilla JavaScript. Just clone or download as a zip file and you're good to go.

## User Story (Work-in-progress)

Here are the things you can do in this web app:

- User can enter a search query into an input field.

- User can submit the query. This will call an API that will return an array of books with the corresponding data (Title, Author, Published Date, Picture, etc).

- User can see the list of books appearing on the page.

## Contributing

Currently, I'm not looking for contributors as I'm using this project to practice my coding skills. There will be an opportunity for contributing this project in the future after I'm done building the first version.
